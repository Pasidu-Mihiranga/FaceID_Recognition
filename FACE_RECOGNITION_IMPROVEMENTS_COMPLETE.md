## üîß **Technical Enhancements:**

### **Video Registration:**
```python
# Enhanced guidance phases
guidance_phases = [
    "Look straight at the camera",           # 2s
    "Turn head left (45 degrees)",           # 3s  
    "Look straight again",                  # 1s
    "Turn head further left (90 degrees)",   # 2s
    "Look straight again",                  # 1s
    "Turn head right (45 degrees)",         # 3s
    "Look straight again",                  # 1s
    "Turn head further right (90 degrees)",  # 2s
    "Look straight and smile",              # 2s
    "Look up slightly (30 degrees)",       # 2s
    "Look down slightly (30 degrees)",      # 2s
    "Tilt head to the left",               # 2s
    "Tilt head to the right",              # 2s
    "Look straight - final capture"        # 1s
]
```

### **Frame Quality Scoring:**
```python
# Multi-factor quality assessment
score = (
    confidence_score * 0.25 +      # Detection confidence
    size_score * 0.20 +           # Optimal face size
    position_score * 0.15 +       # Centered positioning
    sharpness_score * 0.15 +      # Image clarity
    brightness_score * 0.10 +     # Proper lighting
    ratio_score * 0.10 +          # Face proportions
    diversity_score * 0.05         # Angle variety
)
```

### **Image Enhancement Pipeline:**
```python
# 5-step enhancement for phone photos
enhanced_image = (
    resize_to_160x160(image) +           # Resolution normalization
    normalize_lighting(image) +          # CLAHE lighting correction
    enhance_contrast(image) +            # Gamma correction
    reduce_noise(image) +                # Bilateral filtering
    sharpen_image(image)                 # Controlled sharpening
)
```

## üß™ **Testing Instructions:**
